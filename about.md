# About me

I started my Atlassian journey as a support/tester at one of the biggest Atlassian platinum partners in Czech Republic, Morosystems s.r.o. After only a few months I already managed to pass several certification exams and started profiling towards the administration role. 
After comming back to Slovakia for family reasons, I was given an oppourtunity to work remotely for a former gold Atlassian partner, Servodata a.s., where my groovy skills started to flourish. My focus was set on upgrading, installing, sizing of Atlassian applications, aswell as dynamic forms, workflow automations and other forms of custom solutions.
My latest and still ongoing client is the biggest Atlassian platinum partner in Czech Republic, Ixperta s.r.o. My role in the company is similiar, only with more seniority. 
Occassionaly I provide consultation services to Tipsport CZ, the biggest betting company in Czech Republic.
